Lecture 6 - Intro to Angular
=======

###Summary

Here's a simple app demonstrating how angular works. We'll go very simple this first time and make a Student Viewer/Editor.

###Database

Everything for this example will be stored in a flat file at `./students.json`. If you'd like to generate you're own data, you can follow the instructions in `./generate-json.md`.

###API

 - `GET /students` - returns a list of students.
 - `POST /students` - saves a list of students.
